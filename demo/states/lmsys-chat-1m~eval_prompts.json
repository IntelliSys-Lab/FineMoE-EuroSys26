Their outputs must be rigorously scrutinized for compliance with all applicable policies. As with all their edits, an editor is fully responsible for their LLM-assisted edits.\n\nBasic guidance\nDo not publish content on Wikipedia obtained by asking LLMs to write original content or generate references. Even if such content has been heavily edited, seek other alternatives that don't use machine-generated content.\nYou may use LLMs as a writing advisor, i.e. asking for outlines, asking how to improve paragraphs, asking for criticism of text, etc. However, you should be aware that the information they give to you can be unreliable and flat out wrong. Use due diligence and common sense when choosing whether to incorporate the LLM's suggestions or not.\nYou may use LLMs for copyediting, summarization, and paraphrasing, but note that they may not properly detect grammatical errors or keep key information intact. Use due diligence and heavily edit the response. You may also ask the LLM to correct deficiencies such as missing information in a summary or an unencyclopedic, e.g. promotional tone.\nYou are responsible for making sure that using an LLM will not be disruptive to Wikipedia.\nYou must denote that a LLM was used in the edit summary.\nLLM-created works are not reliable sources. Unless their outputs were published by reliable outlets with rigorous oversight, they should not be cited in our articles.\nWik"}, {"prompt": "Improve the wording:\n\nWe release an updated leaderboard with more models and new data we collected last week, after the release of the anonymous Chatbot Arena.

In August 1982, the first compact disc was manufactured. It was then released in October 1982 in Japan and branded as Digital Audio Compact Disc. It was released on March 2, 1983 in North America and Europe.\nThe format was later adapted (as CD-ROM) for general-purpose data storage. Several other formats were further derived, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video CD (VCD), Super Video CD (SVCD), Photo CD, Picture CD, Compact Disc-Interactive (CD-i) and Enhanced Music CD.\nStandard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres (4.7 in) and are designed to hold up to 74 minutes of uncompressed stereo digital audio or about 650 MiB of data. Capacity is routinely extended to 80 minutes and 700 MiB by arranging data more closely on the same-sized disc. The NAME_1 CD has various diameters ranging from 60 to 80 millimetres (2.4 to 3.1 in); they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering device drivers.\nAt the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD could store much more data than a personal computer hard disk drive, which would typically hold 10 MiB. By 2010, hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs, while their prices had plummeted to commodity levels."}, {"prompt": "Consider a programming language that is postfix and based around the idea of an abstract stack.
